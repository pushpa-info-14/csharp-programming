## Similarities between Singleton and Static class in C#?

1. Both Static Class and Singleton Class can have only one instance available in memory throughout the application.
2. They both hold the global state of an application that will be common for all clients.
3. Both Static Classes and Singleton Classes can be implemented as Thread-Safe.

## Differences between Singleton and Static class in C#?
The most important point that you need to keep in mind is that Static is a language feature, whereas Singleton is a Design Pattern. So, both belong to two different areas. With this kept in mind, let’s proceed and discuss the differences between Singleton vs Static class in C#.
1. We cannot create an instance of a static class in C#. Yes, one copy of the static class is available in memory, but as a developer, we cannot create an instance of the static class. But, as a developer, we can create a single instance of a singleton class, and then we can reuse that singleton instance at many different places in the application.
2. When the compiler compiles the static class, then internally, it treats the static class as an Abstract and Sealed Class in C#. This is why we neither create an instance nor use the static class as the child class in inheritance. On the other hand, we can create a single instance of the Singleton class, as we can also use the Singleton class as a child class in C#.
3. The Singleton Class Constructor is always marked as private. This is why we cannot create an instance from outside the singleton class. It provides either a public static property or a public static method whose job is to create the singleton instance only once and then return that singleton instance each and every time we call that public static property/method from outside of the singleton class.
4. A Singleton class can be initialized lazily or loaded automatically by CLR (Common Language Runtime) when the program or namespace containing the Singleton class is loaded, i.e., Eager Loading. Whereas a static class is generally initialized when it is loaded for the first time, and it may lead to potential classloader issues.
5. It is impossible to pass the static class as a method parameter, whereas we can pass the singleton instance as a method parameter in C#.
6. In C#, it is possible to implement interfaces and inherit from other classes. That means it allows inheritance with the Singleton class. The Singleton class can be created as a Child class only. You cannot create child classes from the Singleton class. These are not possible with a static class. So, the Singleton class is more flexible than the Static Classes in C#.
7. We can clone the Singleton Class object (both Deep Copy and Shallow Copy of the Clone Object is possible using the MemberwiseClone method), whereas it is not possible to clone a static class. It is possible to dispose of the objects of a singleton class, whereas it is impossible to dispose of a static class.
8. We cannot Implement the Dependency Injection Design Pattern using the Static class because the static class is not interface-driven.
9. Singleton means a single object across the application lifecycle, so the scope is at the application level. The static class has no Object pointer, so the scope is at the App Domain level.

## Memory Management of Static Class vs Singleton Class in C#

There is a little confusion about the memory management of the Static and Singleton Class in C#. The most important point you need to remember is that if any class, whether it is declared static or any member of it, is declared static, then that class or those static members would not be collected by the Garbage Collector.

The Static Variables or Static Classes are not stored in the Stack memory. There is some specific space in Heap memory called **High-Frequency Heap** where the static classes and variables are stored. This space is beyond the Garbage Collector’s scope; hence, the memory gets released only when the corresponding **Process** or **AppDomain** gets unloaded.

As the singleton class holds a static reference, it cannot be collected by the Garbage Collector (GC), and both (the Static and Singleton classes) get destroyed only when the corresponding **Process** or **AppDomain** gets unloaded.

## Singleton Class:
**Purpose:** The Singleton pattern is used to ensure that a class has only one instance throughout the application’s lifetime, and you provide a global point of access to that instance.

**Instance Creation:** The Singleton pattern allows you to control when and how the instance is created. Typically, the instance is created lazily the first time it is requested.

**Initialization:** You can implement complex initialization logic in a Singleton’s constructor or a separate initialization method.

**Inheritance:** Singleton classes can be inherited if not sealed, although this can break the Singleton pattern by allowing multiple instances in subclasses.

**State Management:** Singleton classes can have instance-specific state and behavior.

**Usage:** Singletons are often used for managing resources, configuration settings, logging, database connections, or any situation where you need a single point of control or coordination.

## Static Class:
**Purpose:** A static class is used when you want to create utility, helper, or classes that don’t need to maintain state and don’t require instantiation. All members of a static class are also static.

**Instance Creation:** You cannot create instances of a static class. It’s essentially a collection of static members.

**Initialization:** Static classes cannot have instance-specific initialization logic since they cannot be instantiated.

**Inheritance:** Static classes cannot be inherited or extended. They are sealed by nature.

**State Management:** Static classes are typically used for methods, properties, and fields that don’t depend on instance-specific state.

**Usage:** Static classes are suitable for creating libraries, extension methods, utility functions, and other situations where you want to group related functionality without needing instances.

## Key Differences:
**Instantiation:** Singleton allows a single instance, while a static class cannot be instantiated.

**Memory Allocation:** Singleton allocates memory for the instance when it’s created; the static class doesn’t allocate memory for instances but for static members.

**Method Types:** Singleton can have instance methods. The static class only has static methods.

**Inheritance and Interfaces:** Singleton can implement interfaces and inherit from other classes, while static classes cannot.

**Thread Safety:** Singleton implementation may require special handling to be thread-safe. Static classes don’t have instances, but static members access should be thread-safe if they maintain state.

## Use Cases:
**Singleton:** Use when a single instance of a class needs to maintain state and be accessed globally.

**Static Class:** Ideal for utility functions that don’t maintain state and don’t require object instantiation.
