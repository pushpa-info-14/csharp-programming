### What is Lazy Initialization in Singleton Design Pattern in C#?
In our example, until and unless we invoke the GetInstance Method of the Singleton Class, the Singleton Instance will not be created. That means only the Singleton Instance will be created when we invoke the GetInstance Method of the Singleton class. This Delay of Singleton Instance creation is called Lazy Initialization in the Singleton Design Pattern.

### When to Lazy Loading vs. Eager Loading in Singleton Design Pattern using C#?
#### Resource Usage:
**Lazy Loading:** Use lazy loading to conserve resources and only create the Singleton instance when needed. This is especially useful when the initialization of the instance is resource-intensive, and you want to avoid unnecessary overhead.

**Eager Loading:** Use eager loading when you have plenty of resources available and want to ensure that the Singleton instance is ready for use immediately. Eager loading can be beneficial when the initialization process is lightweight and cheap.

#### Initialization Cost:
**Lazy Loading:** Choose lazy loading if the initialization of the Singleton instance involves significant computational or time-consuming tasks. Lazy loading allows you to defer these tasks until required, potentially improving application startup time.

**Eager Loading:** Opt for eager loading if the Singleton initialization is quick and inexpensive. Eager loading ensures that the instance is available immediately when the application starts.

#### Thread Safety:
**Lazy Loading:** Lazy loading implementations, such as using Lazy<T>, are inherently thread-safe. The instance is created only once, and its access is synchronized automatically.

**Eager Loading:** If you choose eager loading, you need to ensure that the initialization of the instance is also thread-safe, especially in a multi-threaded environment. You may need to use locking mechanisms or other synchronization techniques to achieve this.

#### Memory Consumption:
**Lazy Loading:** Lazy loading can save memory because the Singleton instance is created only when needed. This can be useful in scenarios where memory optimization is a concern.

**Eager Loading:** Eager loading consumes memory when the application starts because the instance is created upfront. Ensure that this memory consumption is acceptable for your application’s requirements.

#### Predictability:
**Lazy Loading:** Lazy loading lets you predict when the Singleton instance is created (i.e., when it’s first accessed). This predictability can be useful for managing system resources.

**Eager Loading:** Eager loading provides predictability because the instance is guaranteed to be available immediately, which can be important for certain real-time or critical applications.
